# JVM internals

Well, this is a starting point of a continuous journey into the splendid world of JVM. That is nothing but an attempt to unite many resources, including articles,
books, and videos, into some cohesive whole. Here's an outline

## A bit of history
This section concerns a history of an Oracle's Hotstop JVM. The first release of Hotstop dates back to April 27, 1999. Back then it had the name of "Java HotSpot Performance Engine", which, as wikipedia states, was built on technologies from an implementation of the programming language Smalltalk named Strongtalk. 

## A general structure
When talking about JVM, it makes sense to present its general structure. 

## Briefly dissecting each part

## Bytecode, Garbage Collection, and Memory Management

## Optimizations, benchmarks

## Implementations

## Conclusions

I'll be filling up these as i learn something new. So, that's it for now :)
