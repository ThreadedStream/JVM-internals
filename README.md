# JVM internals

Well, this is a starting point of a continuous journey into the splendid world of JVM. That is nothing but an attempt to unite many resources, including articles,
books, and videos, into some cohesive whole. Here's an outline

## A bit of history

## A general structure

## Briefly dissecting each part

## Bytecode, Garbage Collection, and Memory Management

## Optimizations, benchmarks

## Implementations

## Conclusions

I'll be filling up these as i learn something new. So, that's it for now :)
